# Construction - Physical Component light

## Questions to answer

- Should we separate in a new profile (or in the extended one) the path `crm-sup:P17 is composed of part of type` -> `crm-sup:C4 Physical Human-Made Thing Type`?

## Description

This profile describes the composition of constructions in terms of objects (specific or generic) or other sub-constructions, without any temporal indication.

## What can be described in this profile

- The object that is a part of the construction
- The construction that is a part of the construction
- The type of object that is a part of the construction, documented in a controlled vocabulary
