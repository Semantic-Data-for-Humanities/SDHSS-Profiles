# Person - Biological Family

## Questions to answer

- Should we rename `sdh-so:C9 Relationship` with `sdh-so:C9 Physical Interaction`?
- Do we need Kinds for Relationship?
- In cases such as Archimedes where it is not clear if the parenthood is biological or strictly social (adoption), what class should be used?

## Description

This profile describes the physical interaction between two individuals that lead to the birth event of an individual. It, therefore, allows the documentation of biological genealogical relationships between individuals, without documenting social relationships among them.

Relationships of parenthood that are not biological should not be documented with this profile.
