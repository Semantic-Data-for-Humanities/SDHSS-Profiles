# Person and Group - Joining and Leaving

## Questions to answer

- Should we add a role in the joining event?
- Should we add a relation between joining/leaving and membership (such as trigger, etc.)?

## Description

This profile describes the events of joining and leaving a group at a specific time-span. The actual membership is therefore implied and not specifically documented. If such membership should be documented instead, the profile Person: Membership should be activated instead.

## What can be described in this profile

- The group that has been joined
- The time-span of the joining event
- The time-span of the leaving event
