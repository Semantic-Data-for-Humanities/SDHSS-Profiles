# Person and Group - Legal Location

## Questions to answer

- Don’t forget to delete sdh-so:P48 has specific location (is specific location of) in ontome (check if it’s used in GV before)
- Should we have 2 seperate micro-profiles, for Person and Group?
- How to document the example of the street name change of the Pasteur Institute?

## Description

This profile describes the legal location of an individual or a group, or in other words their official domicile or legal seat. The address should be documented using the Kind ‘Address’ of the instance of `sdh:C13 Geographical Place`.

This profile, therefore, does not describe the actual location of an individual (groups do not have a physical location, as they are immaterial entities), whether it is:

- in relation to another physical thing, such as a Geographical Place, a Construction or any other human-made object (such as a boat). This is described by the profile `Person: Relative Location`;
- the social or epistemic location of an individual. This is described by the profile `Person: Epistemic Location`.

## Examples

### Example 1

The Pasteur Institute (a French non-profit private foundation dedicated to the study of biology, micro-organisms, diseases, and vaccines), has been located from its fondation in 1888 to today at the address 25 rue Dutot (Paris). However, the name of the street was changed in 1934 for Rue du Docteur-Roux, which means that the Pasteur Institute is now located at 25-28, rue du Docteur-Roux.
