# Person - Epistemic Location

## Questions to answer

- Should we rename this profile, as Epistemic location is not that clear?
- Should we add groups? Although groups are technically not located somewhere (as they are immaterial)

## Description

This profile describes the location of an individual for a certain period of time. It includes the geographical place where the person is and/or the construction (building, roads, etc.) they are in or on.

The location of the individual is seen as being essentially true in a given social context even if some absences are possible. This means that the provided location is generally observable during the intended time-span even if at some point in time the entity is to be found in another location, e.g. a person going for a walk in the countryside, or an antique vase being loaned to another museum for an exhibition.

Should the intended relative location be strictly physical, and not epistemic or social, the Person: Relative Location profile should be used.

To capture an official domicile, legal seat of an actor, etc. the Person: Legal Location should be used.

## Examples

### Example 1

It is believed that Archimedes of Syracuse stayed in Syracuse during the Second Punic War (although little is know of Archemedes life), from 218 to his death in 212 BC, where he build war marchines to help the greek city fight the romans.

### Example 2

Ad√®le d'Affry (1836-1879), a swiss painter born in Fribourg, took modelling classes in the studio of the Swiss sculptor Heinrich Max Imhof in Rome between 1853 and 1854. She can therefore be documented as being epistemicaly located in Rome during those two year, even though she most probably left the city a few times.
