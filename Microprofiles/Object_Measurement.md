# Object - Measurements

## Questions to answer

- Do we need to has a light version of this profile? (with `crm:P43 has dimension` -> `crm:E54 Dimension`)?

## Description

This profile describes the physical quality of objects in terms of measures (size, length, weight, etc.). This quality is time bound, so evolution in measurements can be described. This profile does not describe the act of measurement.

## What can be described in this profile

- The measurement unit, documented with a controlled vocabulary
- The kind of dimension, documented with a Geovistory controlled vocabulary (weight, length, etc.)
- The measure itself, documented as a string
- The time-span of that quality.
