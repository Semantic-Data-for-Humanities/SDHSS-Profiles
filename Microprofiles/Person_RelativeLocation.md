# Person - Relative Location

## Questions to answer

- Do we need Kinds for `sdh:C43 Relative Location Type`, such as ‘Below’, ‘Above’, etc.
- Are there other Physical Things that should be linked to the `sdh:C41 Relative Location of a Physical Thing` in this profile?

## Description

This profile describes the purely physical location of an individual in relation to another physical thing, such as a Geographical Place, a Construction or any other human-made object (such as a boat).

This profile does not describe the social or epistemic, and not strictly physical, location of an individual. The `Person - Epistemic Location` profile should be activated in order to document such epistemic location.

Similarly, this Person: Relative Location profile does not capture the official domicile, legal seat of a person, and the `Person and Group - Legal Location` profile should be used instead.

## What can be described in this profile

- The place relative to the person
- The construction relative to the person
- The object relative the the person
- The time-span of this relative location (single date or beginning and end dates)
- The distance between the two entities (in length)
- The reason of this relative location, expressed by a controlled vocabulary
- The type of relative location, expressed by a controlled vocabulary
