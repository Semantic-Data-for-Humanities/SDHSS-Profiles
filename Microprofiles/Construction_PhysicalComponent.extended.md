# Construction - Physical Component extended

## Questions to answer

- Should we add in this profile the path `crm-sup:P17 is composed of part of type` -> `crm-sup:C4 Physical Human-Made Thing Type` or leave it in the Object - Physical Component extended profile?
- Do we need to add generic objects? That would need creating a new property from the class `sdh:C22 Physical COmponent` towards the object type.

## Description

This profile describes the time bound composition of constructions in terms of objects or other sub-constructions.

## What can be described in this profile

- The object that is a part of the construction
- The construction that is a part of the construction
- The time-span of the composition.

## Examples

### Example 1

Fictional: A Roman building was composed of a fountain in the Atrium from 20 AD to 120 AD, until it was replaced by a marble statue from 120 AD to the destruction of the building in 145 AD.

### Example 2

Do we need another example?
