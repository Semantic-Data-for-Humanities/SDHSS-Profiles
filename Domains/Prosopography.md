# Prosopography

## Questions

- Should we put the identifiers in another domain (like basic information?)
- Should we have sub domains, such as Basic prosopography, study of genealogy, etc.?

## Definition

Prosopography is the study of a person's social and family connections, career, etc., or a collection of such descriptions.

It includes the basic description of a person life eventa (such as the birth and death), as well as the social and professional positions of the individuals.

Groups can also be documented, either their formation and dissolution or the list of its members.
